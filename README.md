Ã£a.com - The place to go if you have ever: pissed your pants; wrecked your car; been arested for multiple DUI's; passed out outdoors; urinated in an interior corner or plant; hid beer for "later"; drank alcohol you think is foul because there is nothing else; thought hair of the dog is a good idea; lost a weekend; called up your friends to piece together why you are home without your pants; missed Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner by accident; been fired 'cause you are too drunk/hungover to got to work; woke up wondering who is sleeping next to you; intend to drink a cocktail and ended up drunk, and; you sincerely cannot stop drinking but don't want to live a miserable life. Dude...ever since Mike's gone to AA I can keep my beer in the fridge and I don't have to worry about him watering the ficus tree.
